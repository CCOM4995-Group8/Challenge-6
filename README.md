We started off by copying the terrain from the main project and bringing it into a new scene for the minigame.
Then we placed 16 floors with colliders on top of the terrain for the player and enemies to stand in.

Aditionally, we added all the floors into one Empty Object as a parent node.
We also transferred WaveManager and EnemyManager from the project.

Then we added the walls from a previous created prefab and created a wall on one side of the map, then created an empty
object and called it "wall", then we put all the walls on that object so we can duplicate it four times.

To create the raindrop, we added a sphere and changed the shape. Then we made a material called rain for the raindrop.
